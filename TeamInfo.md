## Project Summary

The goal of the Tokyo 2021 Olympics Management Platform is to explore the vast
dataset with information regarding the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. We plan to analyze data on the Olympics such as information regarding the some 11,000 athletes, 47 disciplines, and 743 participating teams. This project will provide extremely valuable insights into the athletes, sports, and teams of the Tokyo 2021 Olympics, one of the biggest sports events we have ever witnessed. It serves as a catalog for Olympics Administrators, giving them the capability to search for information regarding different athletes & teams, insert new events, update scores, and generate unique insights.
